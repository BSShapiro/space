                <div style="height:50px;"></div>
                <ul id="facts">
                    <li>Mars is also known as the Red Planet. This is because Mars is covered in soil, rock, and dust
                        made from iron oxide which gives the surface a red rusty colour.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars is named after the Roman god of war.</li>
                    <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars has 2 moons called Deimos and Phobos. They are named after the two horses that pull the
                        Roman god of war, Mars’, chariot. They may be asteroids captured by Mars’ gravity.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars is the 4th planet from the sun. It is 227,936,637 km (141 million miles) away from the sun.
                        It would take 300 days (around 8 months) to get there from Earth.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars is smaller than Earth with a diameter of 4217 miles. This makes it the second smallest
                        planet in our solar system.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>A day on Mars lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes.</li>
                    <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>One year on Mars is 687 days long. That’s 1.9 Earth years. This is because Mars is further away
                        from the sun so it takes longer to orbit it.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>The tilt on the axis of Mars is 25 degrees which means that the planet experiences seasons like
                        we do on Earth as different parts of the planet are closer to the sun at different times of its
                        orbit.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars has a thin atmosphere made from 95.9% carbon dioxide and 2.7% nitrogen. The atmosphere is
                        so thin that it’s not thick enough to trap the sun’s heat so it is very cold - ranging from
                        -100℃ in winter to 20℃ in summer.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars has very weak gravity. Gravity on Mars is 37% less than on Earth. This means that on Mars
                        you could jump 3x higher than on Earth.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars is a terrestrial planet because it has a hard and rocky surface. Its northern side is full
                        of flat plains and the southern side has ridges and craters.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars’ surface has many channels, plains, and canyons which could have been caused by water
                        erosion (water wearing away the surface). This could be evidence that open water in liquid form
                        once existed on the surface billions of years ago.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars experiences violent dust storms powered by the sun which can last for months. The dust
                        storms can completely cover the planet and continually change Mars’ surface.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars is home to Olympus Mons, a dormant volcano and the largest volcano and highest mountain in
                        our solar system. It is 16 miles high and 600 km across the base, making it 3x the height of
                        Mount Everest.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>The biggest crater on Mars is Borealis Basin. It is 5300 miles from end to end and covers 40% of
                        planet’s surface.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars has the largest canyon in our solar system, Valles Marineris. It is 4 miles deep and
                        stretches thousands of miles long.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>Mars has north and south poles like earth. The polar ice caps are covered in a layer of frozen
                        carbon dioxide (dry ice).</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>As it’s so close to Earth, Mars is the planet that humans will most likely step foot on and
                        explore first.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>We sent out Mars Rovers (which are like robots) on missions to explore Mars and collect samples
                        and record scientific data for scientists on Earth to study. Some of these Rovers include Viking
                        1, Viking 2, Mars 2, Mars 3, Spirit, Phoenix, Pathfinder, Curiosity, and Opportunity.</li>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                    <li>There is no evidence of life on Mars. However, it is the planet with the best conditions to
                        support life and scientists believe there is potential for life under the surface of mars
                        because they recently found water ice just under the surface.</li>
